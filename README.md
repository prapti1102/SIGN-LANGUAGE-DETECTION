# SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION
Designed and developed an AI-driven Sign Language Detection System using Python (OpenCV, Flask) 
and HTML to enhance accessibility for individuals with speech and hearing impairments. This system 
translates sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time, providing a cost-effective 
alternative to human interpreters and fostering inclusivity in education, workplaces, and public 
services, empowerment within the hearing-impaired community
